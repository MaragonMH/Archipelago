    - Home Terminal is always unlocked
    - L's Shop is always available and has been relocated to the Blade Scout Terminal
    - For equipment these changes are not effective if disabled in the options
4. Whenever you get equipment via Archipelago the traits will be seeded according to the possible
   traits from within the game. This means that you can only get the traits, that specific piece would 
   have if it were dropped from the usual place inside the game. However every item drop has a 
   unique chance at a higher rarity depending on the enemy it dropped from. Therefore it's fixed at the maximum chance of 5%.

Archipelago only updates when overworld time is progressing
